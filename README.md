Feedback:

Content (14/20):
- Your content is correct, well-chosen, and reasonably in-depth. For greater marks here, you could have researched some extra information beyond the course content and presented that.

Presentation and Behaviour (18/20):
- Your website is extremely well-presented. It looks really lovely, with a great material design aesthetic and carefully-chosen colours. Making the colours match the pillars was a particularly nice touch. The additional behaviour implemented by JavaScript is very nice too, though it could have been a little more present around the whole site.

Design and Good Practice (19/20):
- Your site is well-structured and easy to navigate. Your navigation bar is simple but effective.
- Your HTML, CSS, and JS are all nicely separated in different files.
- Your website complies with standards of good practice.
- Your website is consistent throughout.
- Your code quality is excellent, with good use of indentation and comments throughout.
- Your website looks fine on smaller screens and windows, but the menu could be a little more neatly handled.
- Your code all validates perfectly.
